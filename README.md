### RepoRanker - Sorting Tool to Help Manage GitHub Repositories
This project allows users to sort and visualize their GitHub repositories based on various metrics, such as the number of comments, watchers, recent commits, and the last activity date (opened or forked). It helps users make informed decisions about which repositories to keep or delete.
## Contents
index.html: The main HTML file for this single-page site. 
app.js: The JavaScript file that handles fetching data from the GitHub API, sorting the repositories, and rendering them on the page.
style.css: Basic CSS for styling the page.
## Setup Instructions
#### 1. Clone the repository. 
#### 2. Open index.html in your web browser, either via file path or localhost. 
## Notes
This project does not require a server to run as itâ€™s a static site.
Ensure your browser supports JavaScript and allows external API calls to GitHub.
