# Ellery Sparkman - CCV RSE Assignment
### Overview
For this assignment, I created 'RepoRanker', a customizable sorting tool that helps the Brown CCV manage and rank their GitHub repositories. The weighted sorting tool allows users to experiment with different criteria and see live ranked results. 
### Contents
#### index.html: 
The main HTML file for this single-page site.
#### app.js: 
The JavaScript file that handles fetching data from the GitHub API, sorting the repositories, and rendering them on the page.
#### style.css: 
Basic CSS for styling the page.
### Setup Instructions
#### 1. 
Clone the repository. 
#### 2.
 Open index.html in your web browser, either via file path or localhost. 
### Notes
As a static site, this project does NOT require a server to run.
Ensure your browser supports JavaScript and allows external API calls to GitHub.
