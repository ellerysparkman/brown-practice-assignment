# RepoRanker - Brown CCV RSE Assignment
### Overview
**RepoRanker** is a GitHub repository visualization and sorting tool that helps users make informed decisions about which repositories to keep or delete. By analyzing repository metrics like comments, watchers, recent commits, and size, RepoRanker simplifies repository management for developers. The weighted sorting tool allows users to experiment with different criteria, like comments, watchers, and recent commits, and see live ranked results.
